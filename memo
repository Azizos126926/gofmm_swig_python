This is a memo to document what I did for my master thesis on a daily
basis. It not only includes the stuff that I successfully implemented,
but also the problems that I encountered. Moreover, it will also contain
the discussion with my advisor and though process.

I hope this file could guide me to a clear goal of our project.


15.12.2020
Modified set_env.sh, CMakeLists.txt and wrote a new swig.sh to add a
linker file with liblapack, libblas libraries in the run time.

Figured out seg fault problem in call_Launchhelper(). We must initialize
a separate memeory block in runtime

Reading day!

Read format in .i file about swig: %include, %inline, global var...,
static linking, extern

Designed basic working case: first start with the implementation of
running dense matrix

wrote functions: SPDMATRIX_DENSE, launchhelper_denseSPD

problem encountered: see the issue in gitlab with the title 

        Cant read the binary matrix file from .sh

Solved the issue from 17.12.2020 (see solution in gitlab)

modified tools.i file so that SPDMATRIX_DENSE function is callable in python
